    	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
    	<p class="name">By Harsh Patel</p>
    	<h2>Overview</h2>
    	<p>Hipster is a term popularly used to denote a contemporary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture"><font size="10">  subculture</font></a> in North America, South America, Australia, and Europe primarily consisting of Millennials living in urban areas.[1] The subculture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]"[2] and is broadly associated with indie and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store-bought clothes), progressive, independent, or far-left political views, organic or artisanal foods, and alternative lifestyles.[3][4][5] Hipsters are typically described as affluent or middle class young Bohemians who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods.[6][7]

The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2010s,[8] being derived from the term used to describe earlier movements in the 1940s.[9] Members of the subculture do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is overly trendy or effete.[6][10] Some analysts contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.[11]

In a Huffington Post article entitled "Who's a Hipster?", Julia Plevin argues that the "definition of 'hipster' remains opaque to anyone outside this self-proclaiming, highly-selective circle."[12] In Rob Horning's April 2009 article "The Death of the Hipster" in PopMatters, he states that the hipster might be the "embodiment of postmodernism as a spent force, revealing what happens when pastiche and irony exhaust themselves as aesthetics." In a New York Times editorial, Mark Greif states that the much-cited difficulty in analyzing the term stems from the fact that any attempt to do so provokes universal anxiety, since it "calls everyone's bluff".</p>
